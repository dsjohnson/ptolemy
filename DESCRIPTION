Title: an R package for accessing global high-resolution geography
Type: Package
LazyData: true
Authors@R: "Josh M London <josh.london@noaa.gov> [aut, cre]"
Description: This package contains functions for creating basemap polygons
    based on data from the Global Self-consistent, Hierarchical, High-resolution 
    Geography (GSHHG) database. Convenience functions are provided for regions 
    specific to the North Pacific. Special care has been taken to address issues
    that sometimes arise when workin with data that crosses the 180 meridian.
    A separate download of the GSHHG binary files from
    https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/shorelines/data/gshhg/latest/ is required and
    should be installed via the included install_gshhg() function. Special
    thanks to Paul Wessel (SOEST, University of Hawai'i, Honolulu, HI) and 
    Walter H. F. Smith (NOAA Geosciences Lab, National Ocean Service, Silver 
    Spring, MD) for there dedication and maintenance of the GSHHG. Please cite
    their work if you use this package in a publication.
